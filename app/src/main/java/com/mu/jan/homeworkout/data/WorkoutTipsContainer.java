            "“Fresh air helps to wake me up and get ready [to work out],” Conlon says. “If it’s cold out, I’ll put on a diffuser with eucalyptus or peppermint.”",
            "“Every little bit counts, so do what you can,” Robbins says. “You can do squats anywhere. Even a 10-minute express workout counts.” She recommends peppering in a few pushups throughout the day between deadlines — aim to do 25 to 50 in total.",
            "“You don’t have to force it,” Robbins says. “If you don’t feel like working out, encourage yourself to start with five minutes, and, if you’re still not in the mood, give yourself permission to stop. Most likely, though, you’ll want to continue. Endorphins are magic.”",
